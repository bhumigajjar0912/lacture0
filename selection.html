            In this solution we have created a alumni portal for the Goa University
            <br> in which for we have various features like an alumni can register itself
            <br> and update their details which will lead them to create their portfolios.
            <br> Except that, for alumni there are various options like newsletters and 
            <br>events details of their colleges, group chat with their mates and friends. 
            <br>In addition to this there is also a chat box for the interaction of students
            <br> and alumni. Plus the alumni can get regular email and messages of the next alumni events.
